Matrices are at the core of any 3D application and they store all transformations data of an object in the 3D scene.

In the context of a 3D application, a matrix is simply a representation of a transformation.  
One transformation matrix can encode the translation, orientation, scale and shearing of an object.  
Transformation matrices are stored as 4x4 matrices, meaning they have 4 rows and 4 columns and they look like this:

!!! [ 0 1 0 0 ]  
!!! [ 0 0 1 0 ]  
!!! [ 0 0 0 1 ]
