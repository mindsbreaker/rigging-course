### Skinning

[Skinning](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-EFE68C08-9ADA-4355-8203-5D1D109DCC82) is the process of binding a modeled surface to a skeleton. You can bind any model to its skeleton using a [skinCluster](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-2E292C8A-388A-4E77-B42D-165F1C9E1E5F) node.  
And the model will follow or react to the transformations of the skeletonâ€™s joints and bones.  

#### Smooth Skinning

Smooth deformations are provided by enabling several joints to influence the same deformable object points.  
The smoothing effects around joints are automatically set up when you [bind skin](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-8DBA9E62-3854-4348-A0AD-1F981ECEA54F).  
Maya offers three [methods](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-630C335C-B63E-4F2E-A4A4-AEA1DD00B0D6) to smooth skin a model:  

- Classic Linear
- Dual Quaternion
- Weight Blended (blend of both methods).

!!! The **Dual Quaternion** method better preserves the volume of the model when a joint is oriented.  

#### Edit Weights

You can precisly modify the values of individual vertex weights using the [Component Editor](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-B698CC5D-2771-488E-98E8-2D4E31DB3B2D).  
If you want to shape the deformation directly you can instead paint weights with the [Paint Skin Weights Tool](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2020/ENU/?guid=GUID-99189E9D-237F-471E-A02C-BE6593B4828B).
